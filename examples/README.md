# Neon examples

This is the source folder for guides generated to /docs/guides. The folder structure is the same. To start:

```
yarn
node basic/facade.js
```

## Develop

`npm run generate` will parse the files and use `ljs2` to invert the comments and codeblocks. The outputs will override all the files in docs/guides.
