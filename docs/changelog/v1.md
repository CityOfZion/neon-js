  - Transaction creation is exposed as `create.claim`, `create.contract` and `create.invocation`
  - Transactions can be serialized or deserialzed using `serializeTransaction` and `deserializeTransaction`
  - Transaction signing is now `signTransaction` and it returns the signed transaction instead of having to manually attach the signature.
  - Transaction Hash can be calculated using `getTransactionHash` passing in the transaction object.

- ScriptBuilder for Smart Contract invocation

  - ScriptBuilder class is an object used to build VM scripts that mirrors the ScriptBuilder found in the C# repo.
  - `buildScript` is a convenient wrapper around ScriptBuilder to call a contract with `operation` accepting `args`.
